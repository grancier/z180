This ROMv5.1 merges changes from v4b4 and v5. The release includes an
updated version of Paul Aktrstam port of Tiny BASIC for the P112 in
a separate HEX file.

							20 October 2005

This ROMv5 update began with Hal's v4b ROM covered below.  It includes
a few fixes and adds the following:

	- The NvRam now stores an added flag - Hardware Flow Control.
	  The default is "None."  Selecting "Y" in the setup menu
	  allows for much higher terminal baud rates without overflow
	  for those terminals that can use it.  The status of this
	  flag is also passed to the CP/M BIOS for use in the CONOUT:
	  driver.

	- All references to the DS-1202 Clock were changed to DS-1302
	  to reflect a hardware change in the new release of the P112.

This update 4b4 of the P112 ROM contains the following enhancements:

	- Non-destructive RAM scan procedure. The contents of ramdisks
	  (for OSes that support them) is now preserved between resets.
	  Note that this applies only to the memory above the first 64k,
	  the area 0000..7FFF is still used for shadowing the ROM, and
	  8000..FFFF is still cleared at startup.

	- Bug correction in RTime: mon12 was missing from monTbl. That
	  caused the Boot ROM to print garbage in response to the T command
	  when the DS1202 clock date was invalid.

	- The GIDE disk driver now recognizes "standard" boot sectors
	  and not only the "new" format.

	- Z80182 register setup is now performed in the correct order,
	  a software reset done by jumping to ROM address 0 now works
	  cleanly.

This update of the P112 ROM incorporates all known updates provided by
Dave Brooks as of mid-June 1997.  It also adds the following features:

	- Configuration of Non-Volatile Clock RAM settings with default
	  values selected by simply entering a Carriage Return.

	- Setting and Displaying of the Date/Time from the DS-1202
	  Clock. The Year will be accurate over the range 1978-2076 by
	  assuming that year values 78..99 are in the twentieth century
	  (19xx), and years in 00..77 are in the twenty-first century
	  (20xx).  Setting of the date may be entered as Month/Day/
	  Year -or- Day.Month.Year.  The Key to interpreting the values
	  is the serperator ("/" or ".").

	- A slight delay is included prior to the Boot ROM code setting
	  wait state delays as a safety valve in case an inadequate
	  number of wait states is configured.  The delay allows one
	  to enter the Setup routine directly to avoid locking the
	  system (selected by pressing ESCape at the pause prompt). The
	  delay also allows direct entry into the Debugger by pressing
	  the Enter (Return) key.  If no key is pressed, the boot
	  sequence will start after approximately a 6-second pause.

	- To accomodate the new commands, the Boot command from the
	  Debugger was changed from "S" (which is now the SETUP com-
	  mand) to "Z" which can stand for whatever you desire.  Argu-
	  ments allowed with this command are:
		Z	Attempt to boot from the first available device
			 (Floppy 0, SCSI 0, GIDE (IDE) Master).
		Z 1	Attempt to Boot Floppy Unit 0 only.
		Z 2	Attempt to Boot SCSI Unit 0 only.
		Z 3	Attempt to Boot GIDE (IDE) Master only.
	  The "T" command displays the Time and Date, while "T S"
	  prompts you for information with which to set the Time and
	  Date.

The files comprising this version of the bios have been successfully
assembled with the SLR180+ (no longer available) and Al Hawley's ZMAC
assembler.
